# AndroCom - P2P Communication Without Internet

AndroCom is an Android application that enables users to exchange end-to-end encrypted text messages, make voice calls, and conduct video calls without the need for an internet connection. It requires a connection to a microcontroller, specifically a Raspberry Pi, which creates an ad-hoc network that can be established anywhere.

## FAQ

#### Does AndroCom require an Internet connection?

No, AndroCom does not require an internet connection for its core functionality. It is designed to operate without the need for an internet connection, thanks to its integration with a Raspberry Pi that creates an ad-hoc network. Users can send end-to-end encrypted text messages, make voice calls, and conduct video calls within the ad-hoc network created by the Raspberry Pi, without relying on the internet.

#### Is Raspberry Pi necessary for the app to work?

Yes, a Raspberry Pi is necessary for AndroCom to work. AndroCom relies on the Raspberry Pi to create an ad-hoc network, which is used as the communication infrastructure for end-to-end encrypted text messages, voice calls, and video calls. Without the Raspberry Pi and the ad-hoc network it establishes, the app will not be able to function as intended. The Raspberry Pi serves as an integral component of the system, enabling communication without the need for an internet connection.
